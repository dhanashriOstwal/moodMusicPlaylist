"Lead Vocal by Greg  Well, these late night conversations Leave a strange taste, Like french cigarettes. And these coloured drinks That you keep on throwin' at me Just keep on reminding me I came to forget.  So now every night You insist on reminding me Of my lost possibilities And the stains on the wall. Well, I don't mean to complain But it hurts just the same. And now both of us know The leaves will fall on their own.  Just throw me a line That's all that I ask Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast I need love and it's you And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.  Yea, you tell me Life is for living It's best in the giving But it's so hard to be free. Still I do my best But you refuse my gift And now all that we share Is a collection of tears.  Just throw me a line That's all that I ask Well, it's sink or swim and I'm going fast I need love and it's you And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?

The soul is eternal you just change form Then you come back with a new face on You can not limit love unless you lack understanding To answer you yes there is life in other planets The futures a mystery the past is history Today is a gift that's why it is called the present Life is so simple unless you make it confusing The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using  [Sticky] Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you  [Chorus:] If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say? If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say? If you could talk to God  [Sticky] Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?  [God] Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity  [Sticky] I can't think I feel life going down the drain In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain  [God] Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts Your feelings will really erase what you been taught Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth I speak through you to aware the youth  [Sticky] But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?  [God] In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite How can there be left if there was never right? How can something know death if it never knew life? How can you lose, if nobody won? How can it be dark if there was never a sun? That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed Form must exist for part of themself to manifest  [Sticky] But I never asked to be born, I hate my life And if you are God dammit then show me the light And tell me- what's the meaning of life?  [God] The process of all life Is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self  [Sticky] Is God a he or she is there one true religion?

It would be a shame if you go And find that freedom was a long time ago  I know you can't stand for chains to bind you But they just keep on driving us apart.

You would trade every truth For hollow victories  Every empire falls And the earth to ashes turn The lands of my birth Shall be my tomb  The are the lands, the lands of my birth Soon to be ruins, the ruins of my past And when the sky should fall The earth to ashes turn Then you know they shall be my tomb  Where is the fighting man?

La la la aaaa  In a house On an island There's a tale that must be told Of our mysterious Misty Mountains Behind all the songs I wrote Lives an old man in his shadow And they're whistling day and night For whatever whatever its worth for They are whistling for you and I  On a ranch in the wildness There's a song that must be sung About a blindfolded angel Who never learned the right from wrong And though I don't know enough English To describe it's troubled mind But for one thing I am certain Is that it sings for you and I  And I tried so hard to figuring out But I guess I'm only human I've been watching him drawing him Analysing him in every way I could possible think of  But does not really help me You got to sit back and enjoy You know Ochrasy raised and betrayed him Now he sits there all alone With his soul and his legend and his epic melodies They are with us when we crying And they are with us when we bleed  Yes they are with us when we crying And they are with us when we bleed,Happy

How can I learn to fly?  I rose above the tallest trees And summersalted in the breeze I dove with lightning speed and then I shot up to the clouds again  I jumped off buildings with delight And laughed at those afraid of heights What need has anyone for fear When we are free and the sky is near?  Oh, what a boy was I? When do we learn to die?  And when I saw I was alone And no one close to me would come I soon forgot the joy of sky And gently back to earth came I  I've never flown again, said he Because we're all alike, you see Our sickness strengthens unity And no one needs to question me  What kind of boy was I?

Don't forget the high one's majesty, Do not let your great ego awake.  As the holy powers withdrew their support Great plauge infested the land. The earth shook and ruined the world, Seawaves threw up and drowned the land.  Only a few survived the disasters, Left to breed a new generation. Stand strong against the greed, Do not give in for the evil powers Of evolution.",Happy

I ain't goin' I'm gone Up up up and away And I'm on A higher plane With a brain With a flame Feel the fire Desire the same Knowledge and wisdom And understanding Possessed by gods Transferred to man in A script of a book A scripture that looks Like a biblical writing Inviting a hook Of a song sing along with a strong Subliminal Message divesting all men from Criminal Acts of the devil Revealed and reveled Designed to recline the mind to lower level With no spiritual level Read the holy koran Or the bible Because it's liable To be a revival For the weak who seek power it'll bring Infallible power Knowledge is king Knowledge Who wants some Come get it A battle is a test of wits And I'm witted Hard beats a torch And I lit it Stop the music Alright hit it Now that it feels good I'm heating up I feed off knowledge And can't get enough Knowledge is infinite Suckers ain't into it Ignorance is bliss And they're kin to it Party and dance And don't ever glance At a book or look For their mind to advance Caught in a rut Chasing butt Trying to get a dollar Or trying to get a nut Evil feeds Off a source of apathy Weak in the mind And of course you have to be Less than a man More like a thing No knowledge you're nothin' Knowledge is king Knowledge My rhymes make A meak mind anorexic You can't hang without slang So eject it I've selected Rhymes for records To affect the effect Of the rhyme that left Hangin' like a pound That came down But you're hangin' the brain So your brain's hell-bound Lost and found By the serpent's sound What you don't know Can't hurt that's profound Or absurd A better word An ingnorant fool Is a real cool nerd Pockets are fat With an empty head Got a little fame and a name And you're brain dead You count dollars So ya think ya in What good is knowing how to count If you don't know when And history today And it will equal the future Repetitive mistakes Cause the brain ain't acute ya Need knowledge To understand The concept of sacrifice But man don't understand So we have to fight War Killing people we never Saw before Most don't eden know What they're killin' for Following rulers Instead of the prophets The wicked can rule ya But the knowledge can stop it Souls can't be controlled It's a spiritual thing But you got the knowledge Knowledge is king Knowledge My knowledge comes From a spiritual force Stonger than any Earthly source Propaganda Hype or slander I won't believe the hype I understand the Media dictates The mind and rotates The way you think And syncopates slow pace Brains Can't maintain Acertain Insipid inane crass rain Insane lame Traditions All praise fame Positions Want to be a star Drive a big car Live bourgeios Ane won't know who you are Lost in the source And praising the dollar Whether your faith is Christ or allah The knowledge of god Will teach one thing The dollar is moot Knowledge is king,Happy

So get lovely lovely lovely my girl I don't wanna be the one to tell you The luckiest luckiest luckiest world Is the on between your eyes Imagine-magine if we we were thin In the crown of the conqueror worm And as time pens down we'll say that we'll always feel this way.  Shock to the heart and away we go And if you wake up in the morning and it still feels wrong Then put your money in the sad machines For bombs, punks and tiger teams  Wear heavy metal pants for the labelin' head Who can blame it on the band who killed themselves next door For just another little chance to love a lie Isay they loved a lie. And we will kick them straight down the line With a conscience clear of mind.  So get lovely lovely lovely my girl I don't wanna be the one to tell you The luckiest luckiest luckiest world Is the on between your eyes Imagine-magine if we we were thin In the torch of the Conqueror Worm And as time pens down we'll say that we'll always feel this way. Hey.... Hey...  Chorus repeat... In the mouth of the Conqueror Worm And as time pens down we'll say that we'll always feel this way.  Hold on The Conqueror Worm And screw your courage to the hardest part They're only looking for an open chance to break your heart",Sad

Would you be long, would you be long  Oh in the light of day It feels right Comfortable to the bone From head to toe Gone the evening when the shadows fall Will I call your name?

Repeat Chorus  He don't got no income tax 'cause he don't got no dough, Still he gets along just fine, how we'll never know, He's got everything he wants, a girl, a drink, a song, If we use his formula, we surely can't go wrong. His favorite playground is anywhere there's girls, He's got that somethin' that sets their hearts a-whirl, It couldn't be his money 'cause he ain't got a peso, But when he wants a kiss all he's got to do is say so  Repeat Chorus",Happy

"In a rusted red Chevy with a heart full of glory She left that night A suitcase at the door open wide let the cold air come in And then she asked me for a light  Said she had some old business see an old friend Or maybe make a new start But the words of her reason they changed with the season And the truth burned in my heart  It blew me away and I thought I'd go crazy 'Cause I knew even then I was caught  I'm caught in the rain again I pray to the Heavens to defend me I'm caught in the rain Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?  So I listen to the wind for the answer Time hangs heavy on my face I run from the storm that's on it's way Until I find there is no place  No person, no thing I can run to, no shelter I can gain from the rain Yes I know this time it's too late, now  'Cause I'm caught in the rain again And I pray to the Heavens to defend me I'm caught in the rain Why's it seem like more rain that they send me? And they send me  And the rain comes down so silently And time stand's still like it's in front of me And the years turn to the rain And this silence kills me  So now in this one horse town bar I sing in the back room in the December night Here she comes through the doorway With a blustering wind that's too cold to forget  She looks like she knew me The heat shot through me, melted me down So we sat and talked about the old days Or any new things that we found  Talked about the days when we were so much younger and innocent We saw it plain, we were just caught in the rain  We're caught in the rain again I pray to the Heavens to defend me Caught in the rain Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?  I'm out here on my knees And my love knows I've been trying Still I'm caught in the rain on these old fool ideas I'm relying So I guess she gets me the rain again",Sad

They sat together in the park As the evening sky grew dark She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones It was then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight And watched out for a simple twist of fate.  They walked alone by the old canal A little confused I remember well And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train Moving with a simple twist of fate.  A saxophone someplace far off played As she was walking on by the arcade As the light bust through a-beat-up shade where he was waking up She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate And forgot about a simple twist of fate.  He woke up the room was bare He didn't see her anywhere He told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate Brought on by a simple twist of fate.  He hears the ticking of the clocks And walks along with a parrot that talks Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in Maybe she'll pick him out again how long must he wait One more time for a simple twist of fate.  People tell me it's a sin To know and feel too much within I still believe she was my twin but I lost the ring She was born in spring but I was born too late Blame it on a simple twist of fate.,Sad

Mtv raps A show, mainly for the black And still we can't ill, cause to them that's wrong Cause like P. E. Said, we're too black and too strong But hey, what can I say (brothers and sisters) that's a price a rapper must pay  Chorus  Verse two: pmd  As airwaves collapse rap shows at a standstill Some racial circuits the frequencies can't handle The funk tracks produced by epmd But it's a fat jam, that will never win a grammy Unless we sellout and kill the black movement dead Which means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead And stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a black president And rap about a black crack, the mayor in our residence Give me a break brothers, it's time to take a stand And kill that no sir, yes sir, and thank you ma'am 'cause the word is a luxury a black man can't afford That's why poverty's on the rise and we still ignored And it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks And if we let it, rap would be run by politics I read it somewhere that every man's created equal But not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel Which means next time, so observe these rhymes And take a stand and go for yours cause I'm going for mine That's why I  Chorus  Verse three: erick sermon, pmd  Why is that when wrong is done by the black It's blown out of proportion and immediately attacked By the press and yes, conflict is caused By the kids at concerts who bumrush the doors One child gets hurt, the press gets pesty But what about the beatles, g, and elvis presley Same stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence So (fight the power) and make them understand But too much power and you might get banned So if you want airplay You can't be too black and hey, watch what you say, but ayo  Chorus: to fade",Happy

This blood drenched man, seemed to cry for help, as he stared at me, his eyes were changing. Rising to his feet, incapacitated, puking violently, charging straight for me.

Terrified, running up the stairs, finally found the shotgun kept under my bed. It's time to put an end to this nightmare; I'll end your life as quickly as I chose to save it.

I'm gonna put it all behind me Like nothing ever happened between us Nothing ever took place between you and me... Yes Nothin' ever happened And if you se me walkin' down the street I won't even recognise you I'll just erase you from my memory Put it all behind me Because you are erased All erased...  You'll be sittin' on someone else's couch You'll be eatin' off a stranger's plate Everything is gonna get wiped out Like a new start Like a brand new fresh clean slate Well here I go remembering again All the anger and the blame... People in glass houses shouldn't throw those stones But... Something just flew through my window pane  My my my my... (oh mama did it touch you well?)

"Well my daddy left home when I was three And he didn't leave much to ma and me Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze. Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid But the meanest thing that he ever did Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""  Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk, It seems I had to fight my whole life through. Some gal would giggle and I'd get red And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head, I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""  Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean, My fist got hard and my wits got keen, I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame. But I made a vow to the moon and stars That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars And kill that man who gave me that awful name.  Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July And I just hit town and my throat was dry, I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew. At an old saloon on a street of mud, There at a table, dealing stud, Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""  Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had, And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye. He was big and bent and gray and old, And I looked at him and my blood ran cold And I said: ""My name is 'Sue! ' How do you do! Now your gonna die!! ""  Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes And he went down, but to my surprise, He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair right across his teeth And we crashed through the wall and into the street Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer.  I tell ya, I've fought tougher men But I really can't remember when, He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile. I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss, He went for his gun and I pulled mine first, He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.  And he said: ""Son, this world is rough And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along. So I give ya that name and I said goodbye I knew you'd have to get tough or die And it's the name that helped to make you strong. ""  He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight And I know you hate me, and you got the right To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do. But ya ought to thank me, before I die, For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you ""Sue.'""  I got all choked up and I threw down my gun And I called him my pa, and he called me his son, And I came away with a different point of view. And I think about him, now and then, Every time I try and every time I win, And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!",Happy
"He'll start drinkin, and he'll start thinkin about her Again, again and again He musta brought the jukebox cause those old sad songs they just won't End, they just won't end  His old broken heart, it still burns with desire Cause you can't put out an old flame By pouring whiskey on the fire  Chorus: And tonight he'll make a toast to her memory And then he'll take another shot of a 100 proof of misery And his old broken heart still burns with desire Cause you can't put out an old flame By pouring whiskey on the fire  His tears fall like rain but his pain just wont die down Cause there's another blaze that's brewin As he buys another round  Repeat chorus  He'll start drinkin, and he'll start thinkin about her Again",Happy

"Steven dale jones/billy henderson  Speaking of the devil Look who just walked in He knows just where to find me Here we go again I can tell he's gonna ask me to dance But that's not as far as he wants to go I need ten thousand angels to help me tell him no  Lead me not into temptation Heaven help me to be strong I can fight all that I'm feeling But I can't do it alone Help me break this spell that I'm under Guide my feet and hold me tight I need ten thousand angels watching over me tonight  It's time to face my weakness Look him in the eye Lord knows it won't be easy But I've just gotta try I can let myself get lost in his arms That's how I got my heart broke before I need ten thousand angels to walk me out the door  Lead me not into temptation Heaven help me to be strong I can fight all that I'm feeling But I can't do it alone Help me break this spell that I'm under Guide my feet and hold me tight I need ten thousand angels watching over me tonight  I need ten thousand angels watching over me tonight Ten thousand angels, watching over me tonight Ten thousand angels, watching over me tonight Watching over me tonight...",Happy
"Born from some mother's womb, Just like any other room. Made a promise for a new life. Made a victim out of your life.  When your time's on the door, And it drips to the floor, And you feel you can touch, All the noise is too much, And the seeds that are sown, Are no longer your own.  Just a minor operation, To force a final ultimatum. Thousand words are spoken loud, Reach the dumb to fool the crowd.  When you walk down the street, And the sound's not so sweet, And you wish you could hide, Maybe go for a ride, To some peep show arcade, Where the future's not made.  A nightmare situation, Infiltrate imagination, Smacks of past holy wars, By the wall with broken laws.  The leaders of men, Born out of your frustration. The leaders of men, Just a strange infatuation. The leaders of men, Made a promise for a new life. No saviour for our sakes, To twist the internees of hate, Self induced manipulation, To crush all thoughts of mass salvation.",Happy
"My smiles are pretend And no matter what you do I'll never be the one for you You can shower me with gifts But I'll never want your lips I don't love you  I don't really want to hurt you But I tried so hard to warn you But you smiled and walked away You may think that maybe time Can make me want you Please stop trying Understand you're not the man  Every time I close my eyes I see him Remembering how it feels Keeps getting stronger, can't wait no longer I wanna live my life with the one I love And I feel alive when I think about him Touching me and kissing me all night long  Please don't let this go on Do the right thing, tell them why 'cause it ain't right to live a lie We followed tradition To make them happy, but loves a decision You can.t take lightly Open your eyes  I don't really want to hurt you But I tried so hard to warn you But you smiled and walked away You may think that maybe time Can make me want you Please stop trying Understand you're not the man  True love lets your heart decide Who and where it wants to be And everytime I hear his name I fall in love with him again 'cause he's the only man that's made for me  Everytime I close my eyes I see him Remembering how it feels Keeps getting stronger, can't wait no longer I wanna live my life with the one I love And I feel alive when I think about him Touching me and kissing me all night long",Happy
"This wanting more from me is tearing me, it's breaking me But what you want's not mine to give I'm your dollar sign, your brand new house, Your product line When you're done with me I'm spent. When the smoke is gone I have to face what I've become...  Chorus: Will you rescue me? Could you get me out alive? I'm trying to hold on but I've lost the will to fight Will You rescue me? Take me far away from this shattered life.  How can I go on pretending that there's nothing wrong? Life has brought me to my knees This mask I hide behind is killing me, There's nothing left Is there anyone who feels like me? When the smoke is gone I have to face what I've become...  [Chorus:]",Sad
